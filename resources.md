Notes:
=====================================
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library that produces high-quality charts and figures, which helps us visualize extensive data to understand better. Pandas is a handy and useful data-structure tool for analyzing large and complex data.

Notes:
1: Matplotlib consists of 3 layers which are the Backend, Artist, and Scripting layers. The scripting layer is the matplotlib.pyplot interface.
2: The scripting layer makes it relatively easy to create plots because it automates the process of putting everything together. Thus, it is the most widely-used layer by data scientists.

3: The rcParams package of matplotlib is used to store and change the default settings.
4:Histogram is used to visualize the distribution of a variable.

4: Scatter plots are commonly used to map the relationship between numerical variables. We can visualize the correlation between variables using a scatter plot

5: We can put multiple scatter plots on the same Figure object. Although the syntax is longer than some other libraries (e.g. Seaborn), Matplotlib is highly flexible in terms of subplots. We will do several examples that consist of subplots.
